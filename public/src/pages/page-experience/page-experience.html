          My greatest professional experience so far has been leading UNIIT's technology and HR departments. At this hybrid position, I learned a lot about leadership, management, and business. I was responsible for the following:

          * Setting up and maintaining the company's IT infrastructure
          * Developing and implementing IT policies and best practices
          * Designing and conducting technical interviews
          * Designing and conducting performance evaluations

          I continued to work as a full stack web developer and was involved in the development of various projects. I conducted code reviews and mentored junior developers.

          As I was promoted to the CTO position, I had to learn more about infrastructure, security, monitoring, and DevOps. Specifically, I learned about:

          * [Space Automation Jobs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/automation.html)
          * AWS & GCP
          * Docker & Kubernetes
          * Sentry
          * BugSnag

          Thanks to this experience, I learned about the importance of communication and teamwork.

          UNIIT was my first-ever full-time job and it was the best kind of first job I could have asked for. I was given a lot of freedom and trust to work on various projects. As a full stack web developer, I participated in the development of web applications using technologies such as:

          * JavaScript (ES6+)
          * TypeScript
          * React
          * Node.js
          * Express
          * PostgreSQL
          * Prisma ORM
          * GraphQL
          * Nexus
          * Deno
          * Fresh
          * PocketBase
          * etc.

          As part of my daily agenda, I also conducted code reviews and mentored junior developers.

          I always had passion towards graphic design and art in general. When I was 15 years old, I started to learn design tools and attempted my first design contents on various freelance platforms. At first, it didn't go that well as my work wasn't of high quality. But with time and practice, I grew professionally and started to earn some money. My biggest success was winning several contents on 99designs.

          Experience in graphic design helped me to understand the importance of visual communication and user experience. It also helped me to develop a good eye for detail and aesthetics. To this day, I use these skills in my web development work.

          TPCIT - Tashkent Professional College of Information Technologies was my first step into the world of IT. I learned the basics of programming, computer networks, and databases. To be honest, we didn't do much coding there, still it was an important step for my journey into the world of web development.
